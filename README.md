# Comida
A recipe site created by me as a fun little sideproject. I have used Vue CLI as frontend and Wordpress API as backend.
The site is not live yet so if you want to take a look simply clone the repository and follow the instructions below!

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
### Wordpress
```
Run Wordpress locally via WAMP or MAMP
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
